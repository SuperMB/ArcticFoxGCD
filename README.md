## VivadoProject
This is a Vivado project that is designed for the <a src="https://digilent.com/shop/cmod-s7-breadboardable-spartan-7-fpga-module/">Digilent Cmod S7</a>. This board was selected because it is cost affordable and easy to use with a PC. Feel free to change it to a different board / FPGA / vendor. Note, if you intend to use the Cmod S7, you will need to install Vivado and install Digilent board files.
